Hand data taken from (not added to repo): https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog/version/1

How it works: 
1. Use record.py to take a picture of your hand
2. Run train.py and it will output the name of the hand position (currently supports palm, l-shape)

Use getdata.py to extract more data from Kaggle dataset
